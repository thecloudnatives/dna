# Fikaworks has members and a more broader community

Currently there are 4 (founding/board) members: Jason, Catalin, Etienne and Hamish

Our broader community consist of all the people present on Slack (~40 members).

## New community members (slack)

- Every Slack/community member can propose new joiners for Slack (there are no strings attached)
- Board members will send invites
- Slack/community members will have access to all public channels and they decide if they wanna become full members

## Full members responsabilities and guiding principles

- Every member must have their own limited liability company (like a B.V. in NL, SRL in Romania, etc.)
- New members can join the collective after an incubation period of at least 6 months and after unanimous approval from current members
- A collective member can recommend new members for incubation
- Every member gets equal voting rights (after finishing the incubation period)
- Every member should contribute to the brand enhancement by generating content, participating/organizing events or contributing to open source projects.
- Every member will be on rotation responsible for administrative tasks.
- Pay the quarterly contributions at a set rate (should be reviewed on a quarterly basis to maintain a static surplus of money in the accounts)
- Semi annual meetings will determine what to do with surplus funds.
- New coop-wide expenses should be approved unanimously by the team
- Shared expenses for a subset of members may be put through the coop
- Expulsion from the coop should be approved by all other members (there should be a serious reason for doing this. E.g. a violation of the code of conduct - WIP)
- A minimum agreed rate should be applied for all projects related to the coop and can be reviewed during any board meeting (exceptions need to be discussed before agreeing on a lower rate)
- Board meetings should be held at least twice per year, members are expected to attend at least one every year. 
- Board meetings can be organized as part of team outings/team-buildings.
- Members can quit the collective whenever they want but we expect a professional finish/handover of their projects (if any) and a notification of exit towards the members (email/slack).

## During incubation new members must:

- Work with one of the members on a collective run project (can be skipped if there is previous work experience with one of the collective members)
- Contribute with some content (open source, blogpost, meetup, presentation)
- Agree with our way of working and code of conduct
- Make themselves available via slack (when time permits) for other members

## Shared running costs and fees

- There are no costs for joining our slack community, the costs are only for full members
- The current entrance fee for joining the collective as a member is 300 euro
- Quarterly contribution (currently it is 50 euro but this will fluctuate as we'll have more shared costs E.g. design, paid services and software).
- There is no exit fee, but members sould have no debt towards the collective ( E.g. quarterly payments)
