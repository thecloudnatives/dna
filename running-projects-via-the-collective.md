# Running projects via the collective

- We will run via the collective limited liability company (BV) the projects that require more than 1 FikaWorks member
- The invoicing and money flow will be: `customer` ->  `fikaworks BV` -> `member company (or external contractor)`
- There will be a contract between client and FikaWorks BV and a different contract between FikaWorks BV and the members (or external contractors)
- The contract terms between FikaWorks and the members (external contractors) will mirror the contract terms between customer and FikaWorks (scope of work, notice period, etc)
- The members (external contractors) are not allowed to sub-contarct their work to 3rd parties.
- The liability will always be passed to the members (external contractors) that are executing the project.

## Distributing projects
- Jobs will go first to the collective members and then will be shared with the broader slack community (called here contractors)

## Project Financials

- Fee for external contractors/fikaworks community members: 10% (for the first 3 months of the project). The fee will be used to cover admin costs (invoicing, FikaWorks logistics) and sales effort.
- We can pay back the fee if the contractor/community member joins the collective as a full member (in 1 year)
- Incubating members will not pay a fee
- Minimum rate for executing a project: [confidential] euro
- Minimum asking rate [confidential] euro
- Exception for accepting lower rates to be discussed in the collective
- For projects with 2 or more members we will charge the same rate for everybody (negociate a team rate).

## Dropping projects procedure
- Exit clause (from members/contractors) should to match client contract
